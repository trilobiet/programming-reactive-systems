/*
Snapshot(key, valueOption, seq) is sent by the Replicator to the appropriate secondary
replica to indicate a new state of the given key. valueOption has the same meaning as for
Replicate messages. The sender of the Snapshot message shall be the Replicator.
The Snapshot message provides a sequence number (seq) to enforce ordering between the updates.
Updates for a given secondary replica must be processed in contiguous ascending sequence number order;
this ensures that updates for every single key are applied in the correct order.
Each Replicator uses its own number sequence starting at zero. When a snapshot arrives at a Replica with
a sequence number which is greater than the currently expected number, then that snapshot must be ignored
(meaning no state change and no reaction). When a snapshot arrives at a Replica with a sequence number
which is smaller than the currently expected number, then that snapshot must be ignored and immediately
acknowledged as described below. The sender reference when sending the Snapshot message must be the Replicator
actor (not the primary replica actor or any other).
